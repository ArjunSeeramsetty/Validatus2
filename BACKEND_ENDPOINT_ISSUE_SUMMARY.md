# Backend API Endpoint Registration Issue

## Problem
New API endpoints added to `backend/app/api/v3/results.py` and `backend/app/api/v3/segment_results.py` are not being registered by FastAPI, despite:
- No syntax errors in Python code
- Proper router registration in `main.py`
- Successful Cloud Run deployments
- Health endpoint responding correctly

## Attempted Solutions
1. ✅ Added enhanced segment results endpoint to existing `results.py` router
2. ✅ Created new minimal `segment_results.py` router 
3. ✅ Registered routers in `main.py` with try-except blocks
4. ✅ Verified no Python syntax errors
5. ✅ Multiple Cloud Run deployments
6. ❌ Endpoints still return 404

## Current Status
- **Backend is healthy**: `/health` endpoint returns 200
- **Existing endpoints work**: `/api/v3/results/market/{session_id}` works
- **New endpoints don't appear in OpenAPI schema**: `/openapi.json` doesn't list them
- **Test endpoint also fails**: Even simple test endpoints don't register

## Root Cause Analysis
Possible causes:
1. **Cloud Run caching**: Deployment might be cached and not reloading Python modules
2. **Import error at runtime**: Router import fails silently in production but not during `py_compile`
3. **FastAPI router conflict**: New endpoints might conflict with existing path patterns
4. **File not included in deployment**: Docker build might not include updated files

## Workaround Solution
Use frontend-only solution with existing API endpoints:
- Fetch data from existing `/api/v3/results/{segment}/{session_id}` endpoints
- Generate mock Monte Carlo scenarios in frontend
- Display rich content using client-side logic

## Next Steps
1. Check Cloud Run logs for router registration errors
2. Try force-redeploying with `--no-cache` flag
3. Verify Docker build includes updated files
4. Consider implementing endpoint in a different API version (v4)
5. As last resort: implement frontend-only mock data solution
