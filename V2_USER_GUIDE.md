## 💡 **Tips & Best Practices**

### **Do's**
- ✅ Scrape quality content first (aim for 50+ documents)
- ✅ Wait full 15-20 minutes before checking
- ✅ Use "View Results" button to check completion
- ✅ Review all segments for comprehensive insights
- ✅ Save/export important insights

### **Don'ts**
- ❌ Don't click "Start Scoring" multiple times
- ❌ Don't expect results in <10 minutes
- ❌ Don't refresh during analysis
- ❌ Don't worry if frontend times out (analysis continues)

### **Troubleshooting**
- **Alert doesn't show**: Check browser console for errors
- **No completion notification**: Manually click "View Results" after 20 min
- **Still shows mock**: Analysis may have failed, check logs
- **Takes too long**: 20-25 minutes is normal, be patient
